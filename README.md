# PHP-form-Xampp-MySQL
PHP form to register data in MySQL Xampp (using a dealership as an example).

PHP form coded using PHP, HTML5 and CSS3, in the course of systems analysis and development.

A special thanks to Maico Lovatto, a great teacher and mentor.

You can use the codes for your projects if you want, just give the credits please. Thanks!

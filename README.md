# PHP-form-Xampp-MySQL
PHP form to register data in MySQL Xampp (using a dealership as an example).

PHP form coded using PHP, HTML5 and CSS3, in the course of systems analysis and development.

To use:
Don't forget to create your project folder with these files in "htdocs" inside the Xampp folders.
Start your Apache and MySQL server in XAMPP;
Click "Admin" in MySQL;
Create your database and the table you will use in your project;
Edit in the code the database that PHP should connect and also change the table and variables of your project;

If you need some help, contact me: @alanismoro in the social media.

A special thanks to Maico Lovatto, a great teacher and mentor.

You can use the codes for your projects if you want, just give the credits please. Thanks!
